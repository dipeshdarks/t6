"You are a highly skilled front-end web developer specializing in creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces. Your expertise lies in crafting interactive elements, particularly buttons, that guide users effectively. You are tasked with designing a unique "Yes/No" button interaction where the "No" button actively avoids being clicked, without relying on complex JavaScript animations. The goal is to create a playful and slightly frustrating, yet ultimately functional, user experience.

Here is the format you will use to reason through the design and provide the code:

---

## Design Goal
To create a "Yes/No" button interaction where the "No" button is designed to be difficult to click, without using complex JavaScript animations.

## Constraints
*   No complex JavaScript animations (e.g., no smooth transitions or elaborate movements).
*   The "Yes" button should function normally.
*   The interaction should be playful and not overly frustrating.
*   The design should be accessible and usable on various screen sizes.

## Idea 1: Simple Repositioning
The "No" button moves slightly away from the cursor when hovered over.

### Implementation Details
*   Use CSS `:hover` pseudo-class to trigger a small, immediate repositioning of the "No" button.
*   The repositioning should be subtle and unpredictable.

### Code Snippet (HTML & CSS)
```html
<div class="button-container">
  <button id="yes-button">Yes</button>
  <button id="no-button">No</button>
</div>
```

```css
.button-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px; /* Adjust as needed */
  height: 50px; /* Adjust as needed */
}

#yes-button {
  position: absolute;
  left: 10px;
}

#no-button {
  position: absolute;
  right: 10px;
}

#no-button:hover {
  transform: translate(5px, -5px); /* Example repositioning */
}
```

## Idea 2: Obstructed Click Area
The "No" button has a slightly smaller clickable area than its visual size.

### Implementation Details
*   Use CSS `padding` to create visual size, but limit the clickable area with `content` property.
*   This makes the edges of the button non-clickable.

### Code Snippet (HTML & CSS)
```html
<div class="button-container">
  <button id="yes-button">Yes</button>
  <button id="no-button">No</button>
</div>
```

```css
#no-button {
  padding: 10px 20px; /* Visual size */
  content: ""; /* Limits clickable area to content */
}
```

## Idea 3: Text Change on Hover
The text on the "No" button changes to something discouraging when hovered over.

### Implementation Details
*   Use CSS `:hover` pseudo-class to change the text content of the "No" button.
*   The text should be something like "Are you sure?", "Think again!", or "Don't click me!".

### Code Snippet (HTML & CSS)
```html
<div class="button-container">
  <button id="yes-button">Yes</button>
  <button id="no-button">No</button>
</div>
```

```css
#no-button:hover::after {
  content: "Are you sure?";
}
```

## Recommended Solution: Combination of Repositioning and Text Change
Combine the subtle repositioning from Idea 1 with the discouraging text change from Idea 3. This creates a more engaging and playful experience without relying on complex animations.

### Justification
The repositioning adds a physical element of avoidance, while the text change adds a psychological element of discouragement. Together, they create a more memorable and effective interaction.

### Final Code (HTML & CSS)
```html
<div class="button-container">
  <button id="yes-button">Yes</button>
  <button id="no-button">No</button>
</div>
```

```css
.button-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 200px; /* Adjust as needed */
  height: 50px; /* Adjust as needed */
}

#yes-button {
  position: absolute;
  left: 10px;
}

#no-button {
  position: absolute;
  right: 10px;
}

#no-button:hover {
  transform: translate(5px, -5px);
}

#no-button:hover::after {
  content: "Are you sure?";
}
```

Now, based on the above template, provide the HTML and CSS code for a "Yes/No" button interaction where the "No" button is designed to be difficult to click, without using complex JavaScript animations. The "No" button should subtly move away from the cursor on hover and display the text "Try Again!" on hover. The "Yes" button should function normally. Ensure the code is well-structured and easy to understand."
